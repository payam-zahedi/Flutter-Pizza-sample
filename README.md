# Flutter Pizza APP
It's a simple app that I learned from Youtube, Modify it and added some Functionalities to it.

### Functionalities
- Complex Flutter UI - Custom Painter
- Fake WebService Rest Api by [typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ "typicode")
- Using [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio "Dio") for fetching Data from Rest


### Flutter Speed Coding - PIZZA APP UI
The UI completely Created by @Ronak99 thanks to him. And I just changed some parts of it. [Watch the Video](https://youtu.be/Ob_uJgHseOI "Watch the Video").
